Reflection
Writing programs that are readable, flexible, and maintainable necessitates writing code that is modular, clear, and reusable. In Project One, I created the CRUD Python module, which managed the Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions for the MongoDB database of the Austin Animal Center. Because database logic and user interface logic were kept apart in this architecture, the module was reusable and simple to include into Project Two's interactive dashboard. I didn't have to rewrite any database code when creating the Dash and Plotly dashboard because I could just import the pre-existing AnimalShelter class and link the dropdowns, filters, and graphs to the CRUD operations. In addition to saving time, this modular approach made sure that any future modifications to the database or user interface could be made separately. Other data-driven applications, such adoption analytics, pharmaceutical inventory tracking, or other business dashboards that depend on MongoDB connectivity, might make use of this similar CRUD module.
As a computer scientist, I take a methodical approach to challenges by decomposing them into smaller, testable parts and prioritizing utility over design. Creating a data dashboard that enabled users to view and filter animal data in real time was one of Grazioso Salvare's needs for Project Two. Prior to putting the interactive controls and visual components in place, I concentrated on making sure that database connections were safe and effective in order to satisfy these requirements.This method was different from previous courses, which frequently concentrated on individual programs or methods instead of integrating entire systems. In order to create a comprehensive end-to-end application, I integrated database administration, Pandas data preprocessing, and Dash web-based interactivity. I intend to keep using this methodical approach in my upcoming projects, beginning with data modeling and CRUD design, in order to create adaptable databases that effectively satisfy particular customer demands.
When it comes to helping corporations use data to make better decisions, computer scientists are essential. Our work converts information into useful tools by bridging the gap between raw data and actionable insights. With the help of my dashboard, staff members may rapidly see the results of the animals in the Grazioso Salvare case and decide which animals are most suited for training or rescue. The system increases the overall productivity of the company, saves time, and lowers errors by automating data retrieval and presenting it through an easy-to-use interface. Initiatives like these show how computer science affects everyday operations, assisting businesses and nonprofits in using technology to better accomplish their goals.
